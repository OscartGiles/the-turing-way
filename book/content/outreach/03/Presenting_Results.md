# Presenting Results

*We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.*

> Plan:
> * Discuss the need to be careful on how to present results
>   * Dicuss the two stages
>   * Discuss the two themes
> * Break down points in presentation - including examples
> * Break down points in precision - including examples
> * Discussion piece on over hyped results & misconceptions
> * Examples? 

This was split into two themes which relate to each other:

* Presentation
* Precision

It is also two staged:

* Preventative - presenting so you can’t be overhyped. How to stop
* Symptomatic - Addressing misconceptions / overhyped. How to combat

### Example: Dark Matter and the dinosaurs

#### Presentation

* Embrace and use past misrepresentations
  to engage audience and inform scienceBookend any piece going into public with conclusions
* Consider level of audience knowledge - reduce jargon and acronyms
* Consider multiple delivery methods
  * Publications:
    * White paper
    * Magazine / newspaper articles
    * Youtube
    * Twitter / Facebook / LinkedIn
  * Formats:
    * Text
    * Images
    * Audio
    * Animations
    * Video
    * Graphs 
* Make sure you identify 1 sentence you want as your main takeaway.

#### Precision

* Reporting of similar work / identifying common pitfalls
  * How has similar stuff been misrepresented in the past
  * Are their positive and negatives to be gained from this?
* Get a sense of how your field is (mis)reported on
* Report on errors and uncertainties
  *Utilise errors and uncertainties to further discuss the outcomes and your point. Don’t shy away from them.

You can’t stop fools, cranks, and malicious people! Your job is to make your message as unstandable as theirs. You can only talk to people who will listen.

Look at what other people have said about combating over-hyped.
