# Presenting Results

*We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.*

> Plan:
> * Discuss the need to be careful on how to present results
>   * Dicuss the two stages
>   * Discuss the two themes
>   * Discussion piece on over hyped results & misconceptions
> * Break down points in presentation - including examples
> * Break down points in precision - including examples
> * Reproducibility
> Examples for each section? 

When performing outreach to any audience it is essential to clearly demonstrate the scientific research that has been performed. Without such scientific research there is nothing to engage an audience with, and thus, lose enface on whatever message you are trying to present. However, the presentation of results is the first, and arguably most important, aspect of outreach that needs to be overcome. You can publish on the most viewed website, or highest renowned print media, but if you don't accurately present your message you might as well have not bothered!

Genuine breakthroughs are followed by enthusiastic exploration; soon the speculative is conflated with the possible and decades worth of research is expected in a matter of days. Eventually the public become disillusioned and funding is withdrawn. This is the affect of over-hyped results.

The cause of over-hype or misreporting is often due to a miscommunication or an attempt to feel relevant. It may be tempting, especially for early careers researchers, to make your research sound more exciting for non-domain specialists or the general public. There may be short term benefits, such as awarded funding and a larger visibility. But the constant under-delivery on the over-promised conclusions creates a culture of mistrust and encourages fundamental science to be questioned. Not only will the true research be under-represented but the reported results may be un-true. As researchers truth is one of the largest factors driving our passion for exploration and should be held with the highest regard.

WIRED have a fantastic article on [The Life-Threatening Consequences of Overhyping AI](https://www.wired.com/story/the-life-threatening-consequences-of-overhyping-ai/). They breakdown how a popular news outlet was very selective over what they reported on from a Nature article, only giving evidence for times when the AI beat beat human doctors. It is this kind of misreporting which has the potential to be dangerous and negatively affect peoples lives.

Unfortunately, we live in a culture where it is hard to always believe the latest headlines and so called "fake news" is rife. With a little more care and attention given over to presenting research in a robust way, a cultural shift can start to take place. As you will read through this manifesto, it is our responsibility as researchers to be and produce reputable work. 

There are two stages to consider when collating a research project for outreach:
* **Preventative Outreach** is about presenting so that you and your research can't be over-hyped or taken out of context to fuel someone else's agenda. In other words how to stop overhype and misconceptions.
* **Symptomatic Outreach** is the other end of the stick. It is about addressing existing public misconceptions and overhype within your research. Shying away or ignoring current false reporting or misunderstandings of your research field is never going to fix the damage already done. One great example of symptomatic outreach is the book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs" by Lisa Randall from Harvard University. Randall published a paper on "[Dark Matter as a Trigger for Periodic Comet Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576)", which was picked up by the media. However, the media only covered a small humorous aside from her research, that dark matter could have played a role in killing the dinosaurs. Randall took this misconception and used the flashy titles of the news articles as a jumping off point for a much broader discussion on the nature of the Universe, dark matter, the Milky Way galaxy, comets, astroids, and impacts.

This chapter gives practical tips and guidelines on how to present results accurately and responsibly in order to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions or be taken out of context and overhyped. This can be broken down into two main themes:
* Presentation - How the research should be exhibited.
* Precision - How the research is credible.


#### Presentation

* Embrace and use past misrepresentations
  to engage audience and inform scienceBookend any piece going into public with conclusions
* Consider level of audience knowledge - reduce jargon and acronyms
* Consider multiple delivery methods
  * Publications:
    * White paper
    * Magazine / newspaper articles
    * Youtube
    * Twitter / Facebook / LinkedIn
  * Formats:
    * Text
    * Images
    * Audio
    * Animations
    * Video
    * Graphs 
* Make sure you identify 1 sentence you want as your main takeaway.

#### Precision

* Reporting of similar work / identifying common pitfalls
  * How has similar stuff been misrepresented in the past
  * Are their positive and negatives to be gained from this?
* Get a sense of how your field is (mis)reported on
* Report on errors and uncertainties
  *Utilise errors and uncertainties to further discuss the outcomes and your point. Don’t shy away from them.

You can’t stop fools, cranks, and malicious people! Your job is to make your message as unstandable as theirs. You can only talk to people who will listen.

Look at what other people have said about combating over-hyped.
