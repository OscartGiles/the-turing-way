When performing outreach to any audience it is essential to clearly demonstrate the scientific research that has been performed. Without such scientific research there is nothing to engage an audience with, and thus, lose emphasis on whatever message you are trying to present. However, the presentation of results is the first, and arguably most important, aspect of outreach that needs to be overcome. You can publish on the most viewed website, or highest renowned print media, but if you don't accurately present your message accurately you might as well have not bothered!

Over-hyped reporting of results is one of the most damaging challenges of outreach. Genuine breakthroughs are followed by enthusiastic exploration; soon the speculative is conflated with the possible and decades worth of research is expected in a matter of days. Eventually the public become disillusioned and funding is withdrawn. This is the affect of over-hyped results.

The cause of over-hype or misreporting is often due to a miscommunication or an attempt to feel relevant. It may be tempting, especially for early career researchers, to make your research sound more exciting for non-domain specialists or the general public. There may be short term benefits, such as awarded funding and a larger visibility. But the constant under-delivery on the over-promised conclusions creates a culture of mistrust and encourages fundamental science to be questioned. Not only will the true research be under-represented but the reported results may be untrue. As researchers truth is one of the largest factors driving our passion for exploration and should be held with the highest regard.

WIRED have a fantastic article on [The Life-Threatening Consequences of Overhyping AI](https://www.wired.com/story/the-life-threatening-consequences-of-overhyping-ai/). They breakdown how a popular news outlet was very selective over what they reported on from a Nature article, only giving evidence for times when the AI beat beat human doctors. It is this kind of misreporting which has the potential to be dangerous and negatively affect peoples lives.

Unfortunately, we live in a culture where it is hard to always believe the latest headlines and so called "fake news" is rife. With a little more care and attention given over to presenting research in a robust way, a cultural shift can start to take place. As you will read through this manifesto, it is our responsibility as researchers to be and produce reputable work. 

There are two stages to consider when collating a research project for outreach:
* **Preventative Outreach** is about presenting so that you and your research can't be over-hyped or taken out of context to fuel someone else's agenda. In other words how to stop overhype and misconceptions. One of the best ways to do preventative outreach is to directly address what your research *does* and *doesn't* say. Dispel any potential misinterpretations before they happen.
* **Symptomatic Outreach** is the other end of the stick. It is about addressing existing public misconceptions and overhype within your research. Shying away or ignoring current false reporting or misunderstandings of your research field is never going to fix the damage already done. One great example of symptomatic outreach is the book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs" by Lisa Randall from Harvard University. Randall published a paper on "[Dark Matter as a Trigger for Periodic Comet Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576)", which was picked up by the media. However, the media only covered a small humorous aside from her research, that dark matter could have played a role in killing the dinosaurs. Randall took this misconception and used the flashy titles of the news articles as a jumping off point for a much broader discussion on the nature of the Universe, dark matter, the Milky Way galaxy, comets, astroids, and impacts.

This chapter gives practical tips and guidelines on how to present results accurately and responsibly in order to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions or be taken out of context and overhyped.

<!-- CRS: This section is broken into...? --> 

The chapter is broken down into two themes:
* Presentation - How the research should be exhibited.
* Precision - How the research is credible.


## Presentation

There are a large variety of ways to present results for outreach, from powerpoint presentations, to posters, to interactive demos. Each of these have different appropriate audiences. The practical tips outlined here are for you to consider, and for you to decide how to best approach your outreach.

<!-- CRS: Some will recomend to start your presentation showing them the "end" (the main message), and then 
use the rest of the presentation to take the audience to that point...? --> 

### Practical Tips
* Bookend your presentation
  
  Start and finish with the same conclusion, this re-enforces your main point and allows for early leavers, late arrivals, and distracted people to understand your presentation.
  * Tell them what you are going to tell them.
  * Tell them.
  * Tell them what you told them.

* Know your audience

  * Avoid using domain specific jargon and acronyms. These alienate your audience and creates an atmosphere of superiority around the presenter. Contrary to this, a room full of experts aren't going to be interested in being taught the basics.
  * You should also consider the age of your audience and what is important in their life. Children aren't going to be enthralled by how a machine learning implementation could save money on household bills.

* Tell a story

  TALK ABOUT THIS

* Know your main take away

  When starting to prepare some research or a project for outreach, start by thinking about your main takeaway. This should be 1 or 2 sentences that you want your audience to leave knowing and understanding. This is your starting point.

* Use a wide range of formats

  Even the most interesting person can't make a "death by powerpoint" presentation exciting. Avoid becoming monotonous by varying how you are presenting. Consider using:
    * Images
      * Jokes and memes are a good way to engage the audience as well as giving information
      * Remember a picture can portray a lot more than words can
    * Graphs
      * Using graphs to portray information can be very powerful, but you must be careful. Changing a graph or combining graphs which are unrelated for ease of reading can easily be misunderstood.
    * Animations
      * Animations are a great way to explain complicated concepts that can't be replicated at a human scale, e.g. molecular science or cosmology.
    * Video
      * Has an expert in the field recently discussed the concept you are talking about, or discussed an application you are presenting. Consider using short video clips to give supporting evidence.
      * Be cautious of the distribution of any videos you do use.
    * Audio
      * Audio can give weight to an otherwise silent video or animation. Use it to guide the audience's emotion.
      * For example: imagine seeing a video of a supernova explosion. In reality an observer would not hear any noise as sound does not travel in space, but how much more effective will the video be at portraying the size and power of a supernova explosion with a well designed audio track.

<!-- CRS: Recording yourself doing a presentation is also another tipical method to
 improve your "stage performance."...? --> 

* Consider multiple delivery methods

  * White paper
    * VERY FORMAL, LOTS OF PLACE FOR DETAIL, PRIMARILY RESEARCHER TO RESEARCHER. interest in results and methodology
  * Traditional media articles (magazines and newspapers)
    * Miuch more public consumption. Large wide auidence, less context can be assumed. Interest is going to be in impact rather than results
  * Social media
    * Needs to be very short. Widest reach. Least amount of content. Only good for headlines. Inc links.
    * A good way to have communication with people directly. can develop discussion but also trolls.
  * Personal blogs
    * Generally not a wide reach. Good for your local community. Good place for items that don't fit anywhere else (i.e. personal projects)
  * Institutional blogs
    * Can have a wide reach and lead to talk and funding opportunties. Wide auidence in knowledge. Great to show off the work that you get paid to do. 

## Precision

* Reporting of similar work / identifying common pitfalls
  * How has similar stuff been misrepresented in the past
  * Are their positive and negatives to be gained from this?
* Get a sense of how your field is (mis)reported on
* Report on errors and uncertainties
  * Utilise errors and uncertainties to further discuss the outcomes and your point. Don’t shy away from them.

You can’t stop fools, cranks, and malicious people! Your job is to make your message as unstandable as theirs. You can only talk to people who will listen.

Look at what other people have said about combating over-hyped.
