# Manifesto Principle 2:

## We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, general public, industry, other data scientists.

## Oral Communication

#### Summary:

Speaking with other audiences is a skill that requires some forethought and practice. You need to boil your message down to a single, simple message that simultaneously captures what the main result is and why it matters. It can be very helpful to plan your message in advance, and to practice explaining it to a friendly person that is outside of your area of expertise.

- [Message Box](https://www.compassscicomm.org/message-box-online): This is a simple document that walks you through some of the important things to consider when pitching your work to a different audience. In addition to identifying your audience and the central issue, it suggests thinking about the following questions:
  - Problems? Give specifics about the problem you are solving
  - So What? What are the values of your audience, and how does your work impact them?
  - Solutions? How does your work address the above?
  - Benefits? How does your solution help people? What are the short and long term implications?
  The key here is to think through these issues, and hone your focus on your single main point and how your research fits into the bigger picture. Time spent thinking through these questions can help you figure out how to explain things without any jargon, which is a challenge we often face when communicating with non-experts.

          
- Avenues for oral communication: interviews, podcasts, public lectures. It is best not to think about these like research talks, but instead to apply the above prinicples and treat them like conversations with different audiences with a specific message.


## Written Communication

#### Summary:

Communicating in writing has much more in common with being a journalist than being a scientist. Journalists are taught to write articles following an "inverted pyramid" structure, which differs greatly from the normal way that scientists write technical papers. This appreach can be effective when describing your work in writing for institutional press releases, blog posts, and other situations where your primary method of conveying your work is in writing.

- [Inverted Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)):
    - Researchers are trained to write technical papers where they begin with the most general background story, then proceed to details about the specific methods and important details, and only discuss the main results and impact at the end. Note that this [article on effective science writing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009394/) tends to follow this structure.
    - This is completely different from what journalists are trained to do. Journalists lead with the main results (who, what, where, when, why?) and impact, followed by the specifics, and only at the end do they bother telling any background information. This setup is designed so that if the reader can get the main story, and then only continue reading if they care about the details that are less likely to be relevant for everyone.
    - It is useful to keep this in mind when writing about your work for a broader audience. People often will lose interest if you do not give them the bottom line up front, and your message will get lost. Always remember what belongs in the big picture, and boil it down to only the most essential details and lead with those points. You can then explain with more details about what you did, and give background later on that gives your research more context.

- Avenues for written communcation: social media, blog posts, press releases, articles in the news media (though in the latter cases, a journalist of comms officer may be writing the actual document).

## Visual Communication

#### Summary

Visual communication involves making graphics that summarize your research results. Scientists often produce graphics that are good at illustrating a technical point, but may not fully emphasize the main message. The goal in adapting graphics for communicating science ideas to a wider audiences is to remove any information that is not necessary to tell the main story. If you are trying to communicate your ideas to a journalist, it can be very helpful to have this in mind in terms of the graphics that you share with them, which is likely to help get your ideas across and tell a coherent and accurate story.

- [Talk by a NY Times Science Illustrator](http://style.org/ku/): Far and away, I found this to be the most useful link on improving science illustrations for a wide audience (however, the author is quick to note that he actually has a very well-defined audience: NY Times readers). This is a talk showing how the author adapted numerous graphics from noteworthy scientific journal articles for inclusion in the NY Times. I found this a true tour de force for how clear science graphics can be (I was actually quite intimidated by how great the quality is of each and every example, and it really shows how much room there is for improvement in our own presentation methods when compared to the output of a professional!).
    - In each example, the author describes the effort to really boil down the figure to a single, main result. This should sound familiar in the context of the above: whenever presenting science outside of your field of expertise, you need to know with clarity what the big picture message is that you are trying to convey.
    - Once the result is identified, the author then explains how he went about adapting graphics for this purpose. My main takeaway is that there is no single way to accomplish this: it depends very much on the subject matter and what the message is.
    - Edit and refine: I was also impressed by the editing process, where he showed the intermediate steps where he tried different things and the outcome. I am convinced that I don't spend enough time editing and revising my figures, and instead treat them as more of an afterthought. He was also willing to make significant changes if he didn't think the message was coming across very well.
    
- Aveunues for visual communication: posters, slides, images that accompany news articles, web apps (for example, R Shiny). Multimedia such as videos and cartoons can be useful ways to add additional dimensions to your visual communication, and can be a way to further illustrate specifics. Interviews, podcasts, and other material also falls under oral communication, but you may want to include visual details if the transmission media is video or contains other images.
