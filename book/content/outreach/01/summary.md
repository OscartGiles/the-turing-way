## Summary

The goal of this chapter is provide a manifesto that functions as a set of general guidelines on best practices for doing data science outreach. 

-What is outreach 

One of the main goals of the manifesto is to express the importance of outreach in the research cycle, both in the academia and industry, and this way change the general consensus of outreach from volunteering to essential.

These are the principles of the manifesto: 


1. We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.
2. We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, general public, industry, other data scientists. 
3. We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.
4. We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.
5. We should be advocates of high quality science and promote general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

Each principle will be developed in the following sections.
