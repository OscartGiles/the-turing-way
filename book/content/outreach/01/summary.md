## Summary

The goal of this chapter is provide a manifesto that functions as a set of general guidelines on best practices for doing data science outreach. 

<!-- OG: I feel this should have more examples of outreach? --> 
Outreach is an umbrella term for a broad range of activities which engage researchers with audiences external to the research team, including other scientists, the general public, journalists and policy makers. Outreach can provide major benefits to both researchers and society, from enhancing the visibility of your work to developing public understanding of science. However, as with all research activities, outreach requires careful planning and resourcing, while researchers share a collective responsibility to combat the spread of misinformation and provide the public with an accurate representation of science. While outreach activities are diverse in scope, we believe that all high quality outreach is underpinned by a set of shared underlying principles. 

One of the main goals of the manifesto is to express the importance of outreach in the research cycle, both in the academia and industry, and this way change the general consensus of outreach from volunteering to essential.

These are the principles of the manifesto: 


1. We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.
2. We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, general public, industry, other data scientists. 
3. We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.
4. We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.
5. We should be advocates for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

Each principle will be developed in the following sections.
