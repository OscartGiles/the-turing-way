# Integrating Outreach Into Research Projects


> "We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach"

### Overview 

- Successful outreach requires careful planning, resourcing and should be goal directed 

- Outreach should be thought of as part of the research project cycle

- When should outreach planning take place (writing grants, planning for unexpected oppertunities)

### Identify the outreach goals 

- Link back to why we do outreach, what benefits to we want for this specific project?
- Potential types of outreach

### Identifying resources 
- Who is out target audience, and how do we communicate with them
- What resources are required to ensure project success
- Are we aware of available resources in our institutions (comms teams, grant funding, media training)
- For example, writing a blog post vs holding a stakeholder meeting or public lecture. Resources include your time - do you have ringfenced time. Identifying resources (staff costs, volunteer time, University comms teams, professional help)
-  Does your team have the skills required to do the outreach? Could you develop skills (e.g. media training - grants, institutions) 

### Costs
- Applying for funding in grants (some research bodies encourage research funding) 
- Internal funding oppertunities

### Contact/collaborators 
- Who can help you with outreach 
    - Identify relevant people within your institution. 

### Measuring success
- Once completed assess whether the outreach was successful. 
- Did you get the benefits you wanted? Could you improve on strategy? Was it worth time commitments. 





<!-- 
1. Outreach should not be an afterthought but integrated into the project from its conception 

2. How is the project funded? Does the funder encourage outreach? Can outreach inform part of the funding bid?

3. Identify your target audience (or multiple audiences) - how can you best reach them. 

4. Identify your goals. Why do you want to do outreach? Improve more impact 

4. Do you know who your comms team are and what services they can offer? 

5. Identify Resources can be very variable depending on the type of outreach. For example, writing a blog post vs holding a stakeholder meeting or public lecture. Resources include your time - do you have ringfenced time. Identifying resources (staff costs, volunteer time, University comms teams, professional help)

7. Does your team have the skills required to do the outreach? Could you develop skills (e.g. media training - grants, institutions) -->

<!-- - Carry out skills checks to ensure that the team and its partners has, or can develop, the full range of personal and technical skills that will be needed to undertake the research including facilitation, partnership working, negotiation and conflict resolution. Your academic development unit or partner training and development specialists can help you access learning opportunities.
- Consider how senior members of the research team will allow sufficient time to participate in knowledge exchange and impact generating activities. 
- Consider building space and resources for formal and informal evaluation measures to help your team gauge your progress and advise you when adjustments or agility may be needed

# Manifesto Principle 3:

## We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.

 ### Aims:
 Research your manifesto principle: write down thoughts, discuss with colleagues, find online communities, trainings etc.

 ### Approach:
 1. Review/collate funder's guidelines on outreach 
    - What are expectations? 
    - How is outreach assessed? 
    - Discuss with Simon @ Leeds: What events/ training/ etc does he know about?

2. What does outreach involve?

3. What resources are required? 

    - Money
    - Contacts


## Research Resources

- [Turing Annual Report](https://issuu.com/turinginst/docs/turing_annual_report_2017-18?e=30398675/63660505):
    - Information on big outreach projects at Turing over 2017-2018 (page 77-onwards)
    - Statistics on events held, youtube channel views etc

- [EPSRC Outreach](https://epsrc.ukri.org/innovation/publicengagement/)
    - 'Under EPSRC's Royal Charter, one of our objectives is to "generate public awareness; communicate research outcomes; encourage public engagement and dialogue; and disseminate knowledge".'
    - Grant applications: 'EPSRC would like to make grant applicants aware of the fact that funding can be requested for media training and should be included within the grant application'

    - [ESRC Public Engagement](https://epsrc.ukri.org/newsevents/pubs/public-engagement-guidance/): 'Public engagement involves activities that bring researchers and the public together. It is more than just meeting an audience and telling them about your research - effective public engagement is about two-way communication, with the researchers listening to and learning from participants'

- [UKRI Public Engagement website](https://www.ukri.org/public-engagement/research-council-partners-and-public-engagement-with-research/):
    - 'Engaging the public with research helps to empower people, broadens attitudes and ensures that the work of universities and research institutes is relevant to society and wider social concerns.'

- [National Coordinating Center for Public Engagement](https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/nccpe-projects-and-services/nccpe-projects/national-forum-public-engagement-stem/about-national-forum)


- [What's in it for me?](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/scisoc/rcukbenefitsofpe-pdf/)
    - Benfits of outreach

- [ESRC Impact tool kit](https://esrc.ukri.org/research/impact-toolkit/):
    - Set of documents on supporting outreach and impact

## What does outreach involve?

- Pathways to impact (required in many grant applications)
- Communicating benefits/disadvantages of data science/ AI to the wider public
    - Improving what people understand about AI/ DS
- Press
- Talks
- Focus groups


## What resources are required?

- Resources can be very variable depending on the type of outreach. For example, writing a blog post vs holding a stakeholder meeting or public lecture

- Identifying resources (staff costs, volunteer time, University comms teams, professional help)

- Knowing what resources to look for, how funding can be obtained

### [Pathways statement](https://esrc.ukri.org/research/impact-toolkit/developing-pathways-to-impact/)
- user consultation in the planning and strategising for impact
- training workshops and events designed for specific user groups
- preparation for unanticipated opportunities
- commitment to include principal and senior investigator time on knowledge exchange and impact activities

- Explain how your Pathways statement is intended to enable the impacts you are anticipating.  A useful tool for doing this is Theory of Change (external website)
- Include space and funding for events if necessary for reflection for the research team as a group or as individuals during the research, with research users if helpful. Consider enabling research users to lead these activities.
- Ensure that the participation of users is supported by the inclusion of funding towards staff and volunteer time and identify fully the costs of taking part in research.
- Consider including users as co-investigators in the proposal.
- Carry out skills checks to ensure that the team and its partners has, or can develop, the full range of personal and technical skills that will be needed to undertake the research including facilitation, partnership working, negotiation and conflict resolution. Your academic development unit or partner training and development specialists can help you access learning opportunities.
- Consider how senior members of the research team will allow sufficient time to participate in knowledge exchange and impact generating activities. 
- Consider building space and resources for formal and informal evaluation measures to help your team gauge your progress and advise you when adjustments or agility may be needed
