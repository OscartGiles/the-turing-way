# Integrating Outreach Into Research Projects


> We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach

### Overview 

From engaging the public with scientific developments to increasing the visibility of our work, engaging in outreach can yield both personal and societal benefits. While outreach is a multifaceted endeavour, all outreach activities are likely to require resources and funding. At a minimum outreach requires researcher's time and effort, a precious commodity in competitive research environments. To ensure the personal and societal benefits of outreach are realised, it is vital that outreach is incentivised within scientific communities and the administrative resources required are available to researchers. 


### Outreach as part of the research cycle

In UKRI's *conordat for engaging the public research*, Professor Alan Thorpe suggests that "...engaging with the public should form part of the role of researchers in any discipline" [1]. To achieve this we believe that outreach should be viewed and resourced as part of the research cycle.
The resources required by outreach vary dramatically depending on the form the activities take. Yet even seemingly small activities such as publishing a blog post, require researcher time and effort.

Ensuring outreach activities can be undertaken successfully requires that planning should begin before a project commences. That is not to say that all outreach activities should be planned years in advance, as many ideas for outreach activities will form during the research project. Rather, early planning can help ensure that resources are available to allow researchers the capacity to respond to valuable, yet unexpected outreach opportunities. 

Whatever your stage of your career, early planning of outreach activities can be beneficial. For senior staff this may involve including outreach activities in funding applications (many research councils provide funding for outreach, and actively incentivise it). For PhD Students it may involve discussing outreach opportunities with supervisors and setting realistic goals. 


### Who do you want to engage with and why?

When planning outreach it is important to consider who you want to engage with and why. The reasons for doing outreach are varied and multifaceted. Perhaps you wish to publish a blog post on your latest research findings or a particularly methodology you have been utilising. Perhaps you wish to organise a meeting with potential end-users of your research to help steer future research questions, or give a public lecture on your research area. Understanding your own goals and the likely benefits of the outreach activity are critical in maximising their value. Give personal goals prominence and consider how outreach may aid your career, both within your current institute and future places of work. Remember that outreach is a two way activiity - both an oppertunity to inform the public and to learn from them. 

<!-- While outreach can yield a wide variety of societal benefits, personal benefits may play an important role in incentivising outreach activities. This may simply be building your research profile and CV, but it may be useful to consider how outreach activities are rewarded within your institution  -->

### Identify resources. Make realistic goals? 

Identifying resource requirements can help to ensure that outreach goals are appropriate and realistic. Remember that not all outreach activities are appropriate to all goals. Wasting resources, time and money (both your own and others) is not desirable and in certain circumstances could even lead to reputational damage. Consider your time as a key resource - does your workload allow for outreach activities, and how might you ensure you are able to achieve your goals to a standard you are proud of? 

Consider whether you or your team have the expertise to carry out the activities. This may include both technical research expertise as well as project management, public speaking, organisation, and financial management. Finding out what help and support is available at your Institute can be particurly useful. Many provide training oppertunities to aid with outreach activities, in addition to having communications and media engagement teams who can offer expertise to maximise your research impact. In addition, Universities may also hold internal funds for outreach. For example, ESRC have provided impact acceleration grants to a several Universities [2], specifically to support outreach, and other funding sources may be available.



<!-- - Carry out skills checks to ensure that the team and its partners has, or can develop, the full range of personal and technical skills that will be needed to undertake the research including facilitation, partnership working, negotiation and conflict resolution. Your academic development unit or partner training and development specialists can help you access learning opportunities.
- Consider how senior members of the research team will allow sufficient time to participate in knowledge exchange and impact generating activities. 
- Consider building space and resources for formal and informal evaluation measures to help your team gauge your progress and advise you when adjustments or agility may be needed

## What does outreach involve?

- Pathways to impact (required in many grant applications)
- Communicating benefits/disadvantages of data science/ AI to the wider public
    - Improving what people understand about AI/ DS
- Press
- Talks
- Focus groups


## What resources are required?

- Resources can be very variable depending on the type of outreach. For example, writing a blog post vs holding a stakeholder meeting or public lecture

- Identifying resources (staff costs, volunteer time, University comms teams, professional help)

- Knowing what resources to look for, how funding can be obtained

### [Pathways statement](https://esrc.ukri.org/research/impact-toolkit/developing-pathways-to-impact/)
- user consultation in the planning and strategising for impact
- training workshops and events designed for specific user groups
- preparation for unanticipated opportunities
- commitment to include principal and senior investigator time on knowledge exchange and impact activities

- Explain how your Pathways statement is intended to enable the impacts you are anticipating.  A useful tool for doing this is Theory of Change (external website)
- Include space and funding for events if necessary for reflection for the research team as a group or as individuals during the research, with research users if helpful. Consider enabling research users to lead these activities.
- Ensure that the participation of users is supported by the inclusion of funding towards staff and volunteer time and identify fully the costs of taking part in research.
- Consider including users as co-investigators in the proposal.
- Carry out skills checks to ensure that the team and its partners has, or can develop, the full range of personal and technical skills that will be needed to undertake the research including facilitation, partnership working, negotiation and conflict resolution. Your academic development unit or partner training and development specialists can help you access learning opportunities.
- Consider how senior members of the research team will allow sufficient time to participate in knowledge exchange and impact generating activities. 
- Consider building space and resources for formal and informal evaluation measures to help your team gauge your progress and advise you when adjustments or agility may be needed

### When should outreach take place?



### Getting help and support
### Finding funding

"Public engagement enhances research so that it contributes positively to society and results in greater relevance, accountability and transparency." - Alan Thorpe

<!-- INSERT FIGURE -->
<!-- 
1. Who is the audience
    - Who do you want to engage with and why? It could be anything from writing a blog to build your research profile (help people know who you are; get you invaluable feedback - much faster than peer review). Or it could be large public engagement (e.g. meeting stakeholders/endusers who may benefit - for example, meeting automotive industry members when working on AI for selfdriving cars)

2. What benefits might it bring?
    - Build profile, improver chances of getting funding, help steer research ideas and understand the research problem better
    - Develop your skills (being able to communicate effectively and clearly is an invaluable skill in research or for those considering moving into another field)
 


   - "Don't cut corners – done well, publications can help disseminate key findings to target audiences; done badly, they will promote a poor image of your research and will cost you valuable time and more"

8. Sharing your experiences
    - Useful to share your approaches and experiences with colleagues. What works well, what doesnt. 



- Outreach activities start when planning the project
    - Identify the audience you wish to reach
    - How to reach them (are there commonly used paths? For example, do people use a similar platform for blogs)
    - Identify the resources you require
        - Are you running a workshop?
        - Are you writing a blog? It's easy not to think about the costs of your time for outreach
    - How are you going to fund it? 
        - When writing grants to funding bodies?
        - Are there resources within your institution? 


Outreach should be a key component of a research cycle.  

In addition, outreach can require skill sets which are unfamiliar to many researchers.


 from writing blogs to giving public lectures, all these activities require administrative resources in order to ensure their success. As a baseline, all outreach activities will require researcher time, a highly valuable resource in competative research fields. In addition, many outreach activities  

, but larger outreach activities may involve costs 

all outreach activities require administative resources in order to ensure their success. Outreach activities are resource intentisive, requiring time 

  These include carefully identifying the outreach goals, ensuring the activities 


Carefully planned, funded, skills,  



 a broad range of activities, the success of outreach projects will depend on 

Successful outreach requires careful planning and

- Successful outreach requires careful planning, resourcing and should be goal directed 

- Outreach should be thought of as part of the research project cycle

- When should outreach planning take place (writing grants, planning for unexpected oppertunities)

### Cultural change (towards always doing outreach or not?)

- When should you do outreach?
- Incentivising outreach 
- Blogs become your CV (your own benefits)

### Identify the outreach goals 

- Link back to why we do outreach, what benefits to we want for this specific project?
- Potential types of outreach
- Who is our target audience

### Identifying resources 
- Who is out target audience, and how do we communicate with them
- What resources are required to ensure project success
- Are we aware of available resources in our institutions (comms teams, grant funding, media training)
- For example, writing a blog post vs holding a stakeholder meeting or public lecture. Resources include your time - do you have ringfenced time. Identifying resources (staff costs, volunteer time, University comms teams, professional help)
-  Does your team have the skills required to do the outreach? Could you develop skills (e.g. media training - grants, institutions) 

### Costs
- Applying for funding in grants (some research bodies encourage research funding) 
- Internal funding oppertunities

### Contact/collaborators 
- Who can help you with outreach 
    - Identify relevant people within your institution. 

### Measuring success
- Once completed assess whether the outreach was successful. 
- Did you get the benefits you wanted? Could you improve on strategy? Was it worth time commitments.

# Manifesto Principle 3:

## We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.

 ### Aims:
 Research your manifesto principle: write down thoughts, discuss with colleagues, find online communities, trainings etc.

 ### Approach:
 1. Review/collate funder's guidelines on outreach 
    - What are expectations? 
    - How is outreach assessed? 
    - Discuss with Simon @ Leeds: What events/ training/ etc does he know about?

2. What does outreach involve?

3. What resources are required? 

    - Money
    - Contacts
