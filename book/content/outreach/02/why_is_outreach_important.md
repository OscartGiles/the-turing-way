# Why is outreach important?

The goal of this chapter is to convince you, the researcher, that is your duty
to do outreach. The reasons for doing outreach are various, from career enhancement,
skills development to the pure dissemination of knowledge. 

We have summarised the main points that should motivate you to
complement your research cycle with outreach activities:
    
* Help the public gain some understanding of scientific concepts and inspire next generations to pursue a career on research. 

* Outreach activities can help convincing the public that your research matters and why governments 
(and hence the tax payer) should support it [1].

* The effort of having to explain your research to a non-specialist audience forces you to see the "big picture" 
and decide what is really important. This exercise of abstraction  can positively impact the view of your own work as a
researcher. Furthermore, is an excellent opportunity to practice and improve your communication skills (particularly for
early career researchers).

* There is evidence that having a "public outreach persona"[not sure i like this naming] raises researchers profiles leading to improved career 
opportunities[2].

* There is a crisis of public trust in science, with very vocal anti-science movements in debates around high profile 
issues such as vaccines, climate change, and other fields involving expert knowledge [need quotes]. It is out duty as
researchers to fight misinformation by making our research approachable and understandable to 
the public.
