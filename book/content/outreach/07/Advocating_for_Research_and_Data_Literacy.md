# Becoming a science champion

> We should be advocates for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

The previous sections developed the main points of the manifesto and are an attempt to provide the
best practices for doing outreach and show how the academic institutions can foster and promote outreach within the
research cycle. However, we believe that the effort of individuals is still fundamental in changing the
way science and evidence-based decision making is viewed and approached in society. This section will discuss how us, as individual researchers have the responsibility to advocate for
scientific literacy and the importance of evidence based thinking. 

From herd immunity going into dangerous low levels 
due to the anti-vaccine propaganda to climate change deniers occupying top offices in government, science denial has 
become a threat to our society and the future of our planet. Furthermore, at the moment he fields of data science and 
artificial intelligence are prone to hypes that create misconceptions and over-expectations.
Scientists not only need to spread scientific knowledge, they need to help the public separate the hype from reality as well  
as address the social drivers of science denial[1].

In the following sub-sections we will provide some ideas in how to assume this 
responsibility, these recommendations come from either personal experiences or literature review from
experts in science communication and outreach.

## Becoming more approachable as a scientist

Because science has its own secret language, it can be intimidating to the general public creating a myth around the idea of 
who a scientist is and what it does. Some of the stereotypes are exacerbated by popular culture or the fact that researchers
can be a rare species (according to UNESCO, in 2013 there were only 7.8 million full-time researchers in the wold[3]). All this
means that is our responsibility to  demystify the typical idea of a scientist.

One first steps to become approachable is to understand that we are all at some level, science communicators, therefore
we need to have decent communication skills. A useful thing to have is the so-called "elevator pitch",
where in two minutes you try to sell your what you do for work to a neighbour, a family member or even potential employer. An effective
pitch can get people exited about science and even educate about the importance of taxpayer-funded research[4]. 
Whilst designing your pitch we need to have in mind who is our audience, avoid jargon and always aim for the 
the big picture, as well as any other practices discussed in section 04.

One of the easiest ways to engage in outreach as an individual and become more approachable is to use your own social 
media platforms.  The typical individual scientist’s social media audience is large and personally connected,
allowing scientists to serve as a science advocate for their online friend and family networks.
Posting science related news as well as sharing the process of doing science in your everyday life can be an easy 
way to keep interested colleagues, family, and friends informed about scientific topics. Furthermore, 
in the era where fake news and alternate facts are common, scientists have the expertise to 
vet online content for scientific accuracy. Any scientist can quickly post a comment or share a link to correct 
misinformation in the news or on a conversation thread with minimal effort[5].


## Be an advocate for data and evidence  

Scientist are trained on the scientific method which promotes evidence over believe. This practice should not
be restricted only to our research, but used to all areas of our life. 
When making decisions, consuming news or building opinions we must always consider all the available evidence and data. 
Furthermore, we should be evangelists of this practice with people around us. 

Some of the small actions we can take in this direction:

* When discussing with family and friends, lead by example and use evidence and demand evidence to backup arguments (it would be nice
to have an link to how to do this properly).  
* Actively work with our close ones to recognise false news (particularly with the older generations that might not be tech savy), 
* Teach critical thinking to your children. 
* Have a curated pool of media sources with high reputation on using publishing data-driven confirmed information, share this
with your close ones.
* Demand the news medias you consume to include links to the data or original sources they discuss in their articles (in e
example, if they are talking about a scientific result they should link to the original paper). 


Finally, we need to be extremely vigilant on our own sensitivity to confirmation bias (both in our lives and our research), 
which is the tendency to cherry-pick evidence that confirms our existing beliefs. There are some techniques that you can use 
in order to reduce the confirmation bias which include avoiding forming a hypothesis too early when consuming new information,
frequently ask yourself why your hypothesis might be wrong, or why alternative hypotheses might be right and always try to
process new information in a conscious and unemotional manner[6].


## Address science denial and pseudoscience practices, 


* Fake news is not a new phenomenon, but the internet has allowed a wider  
dissemination of “fake news,” “alternate facts,” and “pseudoscience”. 
* it makes no sense to just denounce science deniers, moralize, expose, 
or even provide scientific evidence that shows how the workshop works for the world. We must understand the mentality behind the denial and be able to tell the story of science with its failures and triumphs, so that the deniers’ story changes, too.

* Moreover, research on a phenomenon called the backfire effect shows when we are presented with 
facts that cause us to feel bad about our identity and worldview, we tend to dig in our heels and refuse to 
accept the facts. In some cases, presenting the facts actually backfires, causing people to develop a stronger
 attachment to their incorrect belief.
 
 
* we do speak out, we must remember that we represent not only ourselves, 
but our institutions, and science as a whole. We should resist the temptation 
to engage with trolls, or become them ourselves by berating “non-believers.” Ridicule will not foster trust.  

 
## Always keep in mind diversity

* science is universal, many researchers do not ocme from the country where they are doing
their work, this section is for them.
* Think about focusing their outreach efforts into their home country, they might need it more
than the country that has received you.
* Do outreach on your own language. 
* This might help you connect with scientific communities
back home opening new opportunities for everyone.


* Main goal is to express that this is our responsibility.
* No need to do all of these points, one is already an improvement.
* Open to more ideas.
