# Becoming and science champion: advocating for data literacy

The previous sections developed the main points of the manifesto and are an attempt to provide the
best practices for doing outreach and show how the academic institutions can foster and promote outreach within the
research cycle. However, we believe that the effort of individuals is still fundamental in changing the
way science and evidence-based decision making is viewed and approached in society. This section will discuss how us, as individual researchers have the responsibility to advocate for
scientific literacy and the importance of evidence based thinking. 

From herd immunity going into dangerous low levels 
due to the anti-vaccine propaganda to climate change deniers occupying top offices in government, science denial has 
become a threat to our society and the future of our planet. Furthermore, at the moment he fields of data science and 
artificial intelligence are prone to hypes that create misconceptions and over-expectations.
Scientists not only need to spread scientific knowledge, they need to help the public separate the hype from reality as well  
as address the social drivers of science denial[1].

In the following sub-sections we will provide some ideas in how to assume this 
responsibility, these recommendations come from either personal experiences or literature review from
experts in science communication and outreach.

## Becoming more approachable as a scientist

* Demystify the typical idea of a scientist ". Because science has its own secret language, some people dismiss it as elitist or politically-driven and unnatural, contradicting human values."
* Not all scientist have to be science communicators, but we can all learn some basic principles 
to improve our communications.
* Think in your audience when you talk about what you do. 
* Avoid jargon, fight stereotypes. 
* Highlight how science is in everywhere we use, need. 
* we do speak out, we must remember that we represent not only ourselves, 
but our institutions, and science as a whole. We should resist the temptation 
to engage with trolls, or become them ourselves by berating “non-believers.” Ridicule will not foster trust.  

## Promote the scientific method as life practice 

* Fake news is not a new phenomenon, but the internet has allowed a wider  
dissemination of “fake news,” “alternate facts,” and “pseudoscience”. 

* Researchers are trained on the scientific method which promotes evidence over believe.
This should not be restricted to scientist only and we should be evangelists of
this practice with people around us.

* Actively work with our close ones to recognise fake news, do not share un-confirmed information etc. 
News without data is an opinion.

* Being extremely vigilant in our own actions a biases, do not be part of the problem. 

## The use social media 

One of the easiest ways to engage in outreach is to use your social media platforms, 
* Write down everyday what you do at work, keep a log.
* Post these notes as tweets, in a humorous way.
* If enough information is gathered maybe write a post.

## Discussing with science deniers and addressing pseduscience practices, 

* it makes no sense to just denounce science deniers, moralize, expose, 
or even provide scientific evidence that shows how the workshop works for the world. We must understand the mentality behind the denial and be able to tell the story of science with its failures and triumphs, so that the deniers’ story changes, too.

* Moreover, research on a phenomenon called the backfire effect shows when we are presented with 
facts that cause us to feel bad about our identity and worldview, we tend to dig in our heels and refuse to 
accept the facts. In some cases, presenting the facts actually backfires, causing people to develop a stronger
 attachment to their incorrect belief.
 
## Always keep in mind diversity

* science is universal, many researchers do not ocme from the country where they are doing
their work, this section is for them.
* Think about focusing their outreach efforts into their home ocntry, they might need it more
than the country that has received you.
* Do outreach on your own lenguage. 
* This might help you connect with scientific communities
back home opening new oportunities for everyone.


* Main goal is to express that this is our responsibility.
* No need to do all of these points, one is already an improvement.
* Open to more ideas.
