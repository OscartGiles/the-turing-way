## Why Relationships?
In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your research out there is simply knowing who to approach and how best to contact them. Even armed with this knowledge, however, the comparatively limited time for outreach and communication available to most researchers can make it very difficult to fully utilise those links. 

The most effective remedy to both problems is to proactively establish beneficial relationships with communicators in advance. Having that pre-existing connection, and awareness of the focusses, audience, and format of their work, is invaluable in reducing the time and effort needed to effectively communicate your results. 

It is also worth noting that while we are approaching these relationships with the explicit intention of utilizing them to further our goal of effective outreach, this is something of a reductive view. As with any interaction, there is the probability of unforeseen opportunities arising simply by dint of being in contact with people and organizations with whom you would not otherwise interact. Although we do not touch on these here, it is worth bearing in mind that there is more to be gained than is covered by the scope of this chapter.

- In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your science out there is simply not knowing who to approach and how to contact them. 
- Good relationships with key communicators can be invaluable tools for effective outreach.
- Given the limited time typically available for outreach in an average project, trying to build these relationships when they are needed can be prohibitively complex. 
- Therefore it is immensely useful to proactively establish and maintain relationships with these individuals and organizations head of time, making them available to you when needed.

## What Does a Mutually Beneficial Researcher-Communicator Relationship Look Like?
The key word here is "mutually". As any marriage counsellor will tell you, sustainable relationships require investment from both sides. As such, it is worth breaking down what each party has to contribute to, and potentially gain from, the other. 

The most obvious interaction is the trading of content for exposure. We as researchers produce potential content in the form of (hopefully) interesting science. Communicators employ their skills to package this information in a suitable way, and utilise their platforms to disseminate it to a wider audience than the researchers alone could hope to reach. 

While this simple symbiosis is vital to both parties, it does not naturally lend itself to establishing a long-term organic relationship. In most cases, individual researchers produce suitable stories too infrequently to build up much of a rapport with individual communicators or communications teams. 

Thankfully, both parties in this equation have rather more to offer. Research is, by its nature, a collaborative endeavour. Therefore individual researchers are all but certain to have extended networks within their field made up of other researchers with whose work they are at least passingly familiar. Not only do they offer a potential link to this network, they also possess a wealth of context for understanding it. Finally, a researcher's expertise in their field makes them a invaluable source when it comes to related content. A researcher with whom a communicator has a pre-existing relationship is a known quantity, and may be relied upon to contribute either directly in the form of a quote, or indirectly by providing context to aid the communicator's own understanding. From a communicator's point of view, therefore, a researcher is in fact a gateway to, and guide for, an all but inexhaustible world of potential content to which they might not otherwise have had access. 

Equally, a communicator has far more to offer than simply doing the work of disseminating information. Just as researchers operate within networks, so a communicator offers an access point to numerous other communicators, each with subtly different interests, schedules, platforms, styles, and audiences. Even if a particular piece of potential content is not well matched to a specific communicator's oeuvre, they may be aware of others to whom it is better suited. 

Finally, it is a fact of life for all researchers that science needs to be communicated to other researchers, and for many there are teaching obligations alongside research. Despite the fact that communicators are seldom involved in these processes, the same skills in which they specialize, specifically clear and concise presentation of information and tailoring to a certain audience, are of great value here. Moreover, this is often an area in which researchers receive little or no formal training, being expected to simply pick it up as they go along. Forming long-term relationships with communicators offers an opportunity to tap both their knowledge and expertise to improve our own communication skills.

## How to do this
Unfortunately, there is no easy guide to making friends, which is effectively what this section would want to be. However, we can offer some general guidelines in how to approach communicators. Bear in mind that these are by no means iron-clad nor exhaustive - everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for others. 

### Identify potential collaborators
Try to be open minded about with whom you might work. If you're looking for ideas to diversify your potential communicators, we have some suggestions in the next section. 

### Reach out early
As we touched on above, establishing relationships takes time and often the limited time available for outreach in a given project timeline makes doing this on the fly, building contacts with communicators as-and-when you need them, all but impossible. The earlier these links may be established, the easier it will be to draw on them when needed, and the longer you will have to benefit from the accompanying advantages as discussed in the previous section.

### Offer first
Since you'll be establishing these links early on, you're unlikely to have a big science story ready to go. Therefore you will need to make your worth to your collaborators clear in other ways - even if it's just saying that you're available for comments on related science stories. Many Journalists ask for quotes on social media these days, so follow journalists and look for opportunities to open a dialogue. **note:** anyone looking to expand their professional social media presence should be aware of some of th pitfalls. A good initial safeguard is to draw a sharp distinction between your professional and private social media presence - different accounts for each is more-or-less essential. We encourage you to go to your organization's comms team for advice!

### Reciprocate and Engage
Once you've reached out, it's time to start developing the relationship. Look for opportunities to discuss you work, it can be surprisingly easy to build up some interest. At the same time, get involved with communication on a broader scale. Go to events outside your immediate field, more broader science conferences, networking events, offer to speak, offer to get involved in science communication & journalist postgrad studies - they are the future people who will be the contacts.

### Tailor your interactions
Keep in mind the nature of your collaborators' work. How much prep time do they need to produce their content? How much time do they typically have available? In which format(s) do they usually work? What nature of content is best suited to their audience? Where possible, tailor your interactions to take these considerations into account.

### Plan for Outreach
One such consideration we particularly want to highlight is that of when in the normal lifespan of a project various communicators should be brought on board. While there will be a large degree of individual variation in this, a general rule of thumb is that external communicators tend to favour "finished" stories and should therefore be contacted regarding the project during the final stages when there are results to discuss. Conversely, communicators internal to your organization gain more from incremental updates. For example, management and directorate members are often called upon to speak about what their institution / team / company is doing, and having up to date information on progress can be a vital resource.


### Don't Gatekeep Your Work
Not all stories need to be hugely flashy or impactful. As anyone working in a scientific field will tell you, discovery is in the norm a steady and incremental process. While small developments and updates aren't as attention grabbing as huge breakthroughs, however, this doesn't mean that they aren't just as interesting or worthy of reporting on. It is helpful to start from the assumption that all projects have an aspect worth talking about, after all something must make them worth doing! From this basis, getting word out becomes a case of finding the right medium or format for the story, rather than trying to find a story for a given format. This is an area where having a wide range of potential communicators available to you is a particular advantage. 

### Be prepared to learn
Any interaction with someone whose expertise is outside of your own is an opportunity to develop your own skills. A point we have hit on again and again here is that these collaboration should be a meeting of equals, but it should also be an opportunity for knowledge transference. Working with you will help improve a communicator's science literacy, but equally your working with them will help you to better communicate. While the formats may be different, many of the skills involved in communicating scientific knowledge to our peers are identical to those involved in communicating it to the public, and one only needs to sit through a small number of dull conference talks to appreciate the value of engaging communication. Anything you pick up about how to best represent your work will pay dividends in other areas.

### Be Prepared
These two words could serve as a summary for this entire section. The more groundwork you can lay, the more contacts you can build, and the mosre thought you can put into how you offer potential content to communicators, the easier and less stressful your life will be!

## To Whom to Talk
The list given below should serve as a jumping-off point from which to begin establishing links with communicators. It is by no means exhaustive and researchers should feel free to go beyond its limits or indeed bypass it entirely. However, it should serve to illustrate the breadth of communication platforms that can be leveraged for good scicomm. 

### Internal
Most, if not all, companies and institutions will have dedicated teams for multiple different communication areas. As these will vary greatly from place to place we obviously cannot provide a concrete list. However, the following are general eras wherein potential communicators may be found.
- Public engagement teams
- industry trade body communications
- PAs to directorate 
- STEMNET Ambassadors

### External
The field of science communication is wide, encompassing print media, both periodicals and books, online media, social media, film, broadcast television, and online video to name but a few. Below are just a few examples of potential avenues you may wish to pursue. We have included a few specific examples of communicators whose work you can easily find for illustration.
