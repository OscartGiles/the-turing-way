## Why Relationships?
In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your research out there is simply knowing who to approach and how best to contact them. Even armed with this knowledge, however, the comparatively limited time for outreach and communication available to most researchers can make it very difficult to fully utilise those links. 

The most effective remedy to both problems is to proactively establish beneficial relationships with communicators in advance. Having that pre-existing connection, and awareness of the focusses, audience, and format of their work, is invaluable in reducing the time and effort needed to effectively communicate your results. 

It is also worth noting that while we are approaching these relationships with the explicit intention of utilising them to further our goal of effective outreach, this is something of a reductive view. As with any interaction, there is the probability of unforseen opportunities arising simply by dint of being in contact with people and organisations with whom you would not otherwise interact. Although we do not touch on these here, it is worth bearing in mind that there is more to be gained than is covered by the scope of this chapter.

- In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your science out there is simply not knowing who to approach and how to contact them. 
- Good relationships with key communicators can be invaluable tools for effective outreach.
- Given the limited time typically available for outreach in an average project, trying to build these relationships when they are needed can be prohibatively complex. 
- Therefore it is immensely useful to proactively establish and maintain relationships with these individuals and organisations head of time, making them available to you when needed.

## What Does a Mutually Beneficial Researcher-Communicator Relationship Look Like?
The key word here is "mutually". As any marriage counsellor will tell you, sustainable relationships require investment from both sides. As such, it is worth breaking down what each party has to contribute to, and potentially gain from, the other. 

The most obvious interaction is the trading of content for exposure. We as researchers produce potential content in the form of (hopefully) interesting science. Communicators employ their skills to package this information in a suitable way, and utilise thier platforms to disseminate it to a wider audience than the researchers alone could hope to reach. 

While this simple symbiosis is vital to both parties, it does not naturally lend itself to establishing a long-term organic relationship. In most cases, individual researchers produce suitable stories too infrequently to build up much of a rapport with individual communicators or communications teams. 

Thankfully, both parties in this equation have rather more to offer. Research is, by its nature, a collaborative endevour. Therefore individual researchers are all but certain to have extended networks within thier field made up of other researchers with whose work they are at least passingly familiar. Not only do they offer a potential link to this network, they also possess a wealth of context for understanding it. Finally, a researcher's expertese in their field makes them a invaluable source when it comes to related content. A researcher with whom a communicator has a pre-existing relationship is a known quantity, and may be relied upon to contribute either directly in the form of a quote, or indirectly by providing context to aid the communicator's own understanding. From a communicator's point of view, therefore, a researcher is in fact a gateway to, and guide for, an all but inexhaustable world of potential content to which they might not otherwise have had access. 

Equally, a communicator has far more to offer than simply doing the work of disseminating information. Just as researchers operate within networks, so a communicator offers an access point to numerous other communicators, each with subtly different interests, schedules, platforms, styles, and audiences. Even if a particular piece of potential content is not well matched to a specific communicator's oeuvre, they may be aware of others to whom it is better suited. 

Finally, it is a fact of life for all researchers that science needs to be communicated to other researchers, and for many there are teaching obligations alongside research. Despite the fact that communicators are seldom involved in these processes, the same skills in which they specialise, specifically clear and concise presentation of information and tailoring to a certain audiance, are of great value here. Moreover, this is often an area in which researchers recieve little or no formal training, being expected to simply pick it up as they go along. Forming long-term relationships with communicators offers an opportunity to tap both their knowledge and expertese to improve our own communication skills.

- Needs to be symbiotic - 2 way street.  
- From Communicators:
    - Expertese with regards to how to clearly communicate
    - Links and contacts with other communicators
    - Platforms
- From researchers:
    - Story content
    - Links and contacts with other researchers
    - A reliable source for comments
- Established over time and maintained even when not immediately necessary.

## How to do this
Unfortunately, there is no easy guide to making friends, which is effectively what this section would want to be. However, we can offer some general guidelines in how to approach communicators. Bear in mind that these are by no means iron-clad nor exhaustive - everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for others. 

### Identify potential collaborators
Try to be open minded about with whom you might work. If you're looking for ideas to diversify your potential communicators, we have some suggestions in the next section. 

### Reach out early
As we touched on above, establishing relationships takes time and often the limited time available for outreach in a given project timeline makes doing this on the fly, building contacts with communicators as-and-when you need them, all but impossible. The earlier these links may be established, the easier it will be to draw on them when needed, and the longer you will have to benefit from the accompanying advatages as discussed in the previous section.

### Offer first
Since you'll be establishing these links early on, you're unlikely to have a big science story ready to go. Therefore you will need to make your worth to your collaborators clear in other ways - even if it's just saying that you're available for comments on related science stories.


### Tailor your interactions
Keep in mind the nature of your collaborators' work. How much prep time do they need to produce their content? How much time do they typically have available? In which format(s) do they typically work? What nature of content is best suited to their audience? Where possible, tailor your interactions to take these considereatiosn into account.

 / have available? What format(s) do they work in. Tailor your contributions and offer stories at the relevent times (e.g. internal sci-comm groups should be made aware of the project at its inception since the fact that the organisation is working on X is content in and of itself and small updates can be used, whereas journalistic communicators should be offered the content at project end when there are results to report - a complete story is needed) 

### Don't Gatekeep

### Be prepared to learn

### Reciprocate

### Engage

### Prepare





<!---
- Identify potential communicator collaborators (see below) Create a broad list of WHO you could contact for outreach possibilities. Internal comms teams, blogs, external journalists, content creators, pop sci, etc.
- Reach out early - establish links long before you need them.
- Offer first. Make your value to them clear - even just saying you're availble for comments on recent science stories.
- Keep in mind the nature of their work - how much prep time do they need / have available? What format(s) do they work in. Tailor your contributions and offer stories at the relevent times (e.g. internal sci-comm groups should be made aware of the project at its inception since the fact that the organisation is working on X is content in and of itself and small updates can be used, whereas journalistic communicators should be offered the content at project end when there are results to report - a complete story is needed) 
- Not all stories need to flashy or hugely impactful, just need to be done well. Be proud of what you have done, not all science is discovering something new, real science is about finding the little changes. These are all small steps towards a ‘bigger’ discovery. 
- Start with the view all projects have something worth talking about. Could be a technique, interesting facet of science, or the output of the project. 
- Researchers can learn from communicators. It’s a transfer of skills. Anything you pick up about how to best represent your work will pay dividends in other areas.
- Reciprocation - social media profiles. Journalists ask for quotes on social media these days. Follow journalists and interact with them. ON A WORK ONLY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
- Go to other events, more broader science conferences, networking events, offer to speak, offer to get involved in science communication & journalist postgrad studies > they are the future people who will be the contacts
- Prepare in advance with information before talking to media people

## To Whom to Talk
<!---
The list given below should serve as a jumping-off point from which to begin establishing links with communicators. It is by no means exhaustive and researchers should feel free to go beyond its limits or indeed bypass it entirely. However, it should serve to illustrate the bredth of communication platforms that can be leveraged for good scicomm. 

### Internal
Most, if not all, companies and institutions will have dedicated teams for multiple different communication areas. As these will vary greatly from place to place we obviously cannot provide a concrete list. However, the following are general eras wherein potential communicators may be found.

- Internal - Public engagement teams, industry trade body comms, PAs, Directorate give talks on other peoples work
- External - Industry & Trade publications (e.g. HPCWire), Journalists, academic science communicators or engagement professionals, science centres

# Developing Relationships with Others

<!-- CRS: This section is not up to date...? --> 

> We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.

Create a broad list of WHO you could contact for outreach possibilities. Internal comms teams, blogs, external journalists, content creators, pop sci, etc.

HOW was a lot harder, it’s basically saying how to make friends. This could be done within reciprocation, be available to external sources for event hosting, quotes, maintain a regular contact. Get in there early before you need to publish something.

See timeline on “Manifesto 4.pdf” document:
![Relationship Network](manifesto4.png "Relationship Network")
