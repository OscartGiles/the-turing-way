# Developing Beneficial Science-Communication Relationships

*We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.*

To Do:
- is "communicators" a good term? Is the a better way of saying it?

## Why Relationships?
In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your research out there is simply knowing who to approach and how to contact them. Even armed with this knowledge, however, the comparatively limited time for outreach and communication available to most researchers can make it very difficult to fully utilise those links. 

The most effective remedy to both problems is to proactively establish beneficial relationships with communicators in advance. Having that pre-existing connection, and awareness of the focusses, audience, and format of their work, is invaluable in reducing the time and effort needed to effectively communicate your results.

- In many cases, a significant barrier to entry when it comes to getting your science out there is simply not knowing who to approach and how to contact them. 
- Good relationships with key communicators can be invaluable tools for effective outreach.
- Given the limited time typically available for outreach in an average project, trying to build these relationships when they are needed can be prohibatively complex. 
- Therefore it is immensely useful to proactively establish and maintain relationships with these individuals and organisations head of time, making them available to you when needed.

## What Does a Beneficial Relationship Look Like?

As the word implies, a researcher's relationship with communicators should be a 2-way street.  

- Needs to be symbiotic - 2 way street.  
- From Communicators:
    - Expertese with regards to how to clearly communicate
    - Links and contacts with other communicators
    - Platforms
- From researchers:
    - Story content
    - Links and contacts with other researchers
    - A reliable source for comments
- Established over time and maintained even when not immediately necessary.

## How to do this.
- Identify potential communicator collaborators (see below)
- Reach out early - establish links long before you need them.
- Offer first. Make your value to them clear - even just saying you're availble for comments on recent science stories.
- Keep in mind the nature of their work - how much prep time do they need / have available? What format(s) do they work in. Tailor your contributions and offer stories at the relevent times (e.g. internal sci-comm groups should be made aware of the project at its inception since the fact that the organisation is working on X is content in and of itself and small updates can be used, whereas journalistic communicators should be offered the content at project end when there are results to report - a complete story is needed) 
- Not all stories need to flashy or hugely impactful, just need to be done well. Be proud of what you have done, not all science is discovering something new, real science is about finding the little changes. These are all small steps towards a ‘bigger’ discovery. 
- Start with the view all projects have something worth talking about. Could be a technique, interesting facet of science, or the output of the project. 
- Researchers can learn from communicators. It’s a transfer of skills. Anything you pick up about how to best represent your work will pay dividends in other areas.
- Create a broad list of WHO you could contact for outreach possibilities. Internal comms teams, blogs, external journalists, content creators, pop sci, etc.
- Reciprocation - social media profiles. Journalists ask for quotes on social media these days. Follow journalists and interact with them. ON A WORK ONLY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
- Go to other events, more broader science conferences, networking events, offer to speak, offer to get involved in science communication & journalist postgrad studies > they are the future people who will be the contacts
- Prepare in advance with information before talking to media people

## To Whom to Talk
The list given below should serve as a jumping-off point from which to begin establishing links with communicators. It is by no means exhaustive and researchers should feel free to go beyond its limits or indeed bypass it entirely. However, it should serve to illustrate the bredth of communication platforms that can be leveraged for good scicomm. 

### Internal
Most, if not all, companies and institutions will have dedicated teams for multiple different communication areas. As these will vary greatly from place to place we obviously cannot provide a concrete list. However, the following are general eras wherein potential communicators may be found.

- Internal - Public engagement teams, industry trade body comms, PAs, Directorate give talks on other peoples work
- External - Industry & Trade publications (e.g. HPCWire), Journalists, academic science communicators or engagement professionals, science centres

# Developing Relationships with Others

Create a broad list of WHO you could contact for outreach possibilities. Internal comms teams, blogs, external journalists, content creators, pop sci, etc.

HOW was a lot harder, it’s basically saying how to make friends. This could be done within reciprocation, be available to external sources for event hosting, quotes, maintain a regular contact. Get in there early before you need to publish something.

Working with internal comms team shouldn’t be hard. Researchers can learn from them. It’s a transfer of skills.
